# Pianonino

Pianonino was developed as a simple piano game. With Pianonino, music notation is just reinvented and simplified, in such a way that playing and reading music becomes so easy, anyone could easily do it.

Thing is, the music theory has evolved for many years and it made possible recording and passing music down throughout generations. As simple as introductory music theory may seem for music literates, getting grasp of concepts like: notes, pitch, class, tone, semitone, can be done in a more pleasant and fun way.

Let’s replace odd looking, unintuitive signs with funny icons. You can have a notation like: Do(Doll) – Re(Record) – Mi(Mitten) – Fa(fan) – Sol(Sun) – La(Lamp) – Si(Seed) or like: C(Cat) – D(Dog) – E(Ear) – F(frog) – G(Guitar) – A(Alarm) – B(Bat). Customize notes by any rule you wish, not only phonetic or alphabetic.

This game has no adds and was built with "education" in mind.
